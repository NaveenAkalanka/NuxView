## What is NuxView?

**NuxView** is a modern web-based file system visualizer designed to demystify CLI structures. Instead of staring at `ls -la` output, NuxView provides a node-based interactive graph and a deep-dive analysis of your server's file system.

It's built for **SysAdmins**, **Developers**, and **Linux Enthusiasts** who want crystal-clear visibility into their machines.

## ✨ Features

- **🌐 Interactive Graph Visualization**: See your folders as nodes in a tree. Zoom, pan, and dragging nodes to understand structure logic.
- **📁 Deep Explorer**: A side-panel file explorer that supports infinite nesting and huge directory trees with smooth performance.
- **🔍 Full System Scan**: Parallel processing backend scans thousands of files in seconds to give you instant insights.
- **🔐 Permission Analysis**: Visualize file permissions, ownership (UID/GID), and modification times instantly.
- **🎨 Modern UI**: Built with a sleek, dark-themed interface featuring glassmorphism and neon accents.
- **📱 Mobile Responsive**: Fully functional on mobile devices with a touch-optimized layout.

## 🔒 Security

NuxView is designed as a **monitoring and visualization tool**.
- **Read-Only**: It does not modify, delete, or upload files.
- **Local Access**: By default, it binds to `0.0.0.0`. It is recommended to use it behind a VPN or SSH Tunnel for public servers.
- **No External Calls**: The app runs entirely on your server. No data is sent to the cloud (except the optional Feedback form which uses Web3Forms).
